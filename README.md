# üè¶ Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Bank Marketing Dataset**, which is related to a marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaign was based on phone calls, and the dataset is widely used for predictive modeling to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

The dataset is sourced from the **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository**:

- **`month`**: Last contact month of the year.
- **`duration`**: Duration of the last contact in seconds.
- **`campaign`**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign.
- **`pdays`**: Number of days since the client was last contacted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. We use **Sequential Feature Selection**, a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the best features from the dataset to improve the performance of the predictive model.

## 3. Customer Segmentation using K-Means

### **Cluster Analysis**
We have identified **four clusters** represented by red, green, purple, and blue colors:

![K-Means](https://github.com/alvin0727/TugasBesar_MachineLearning/blob/main/images/image1.png)

- **Red Cluster**: Includes customers aged **20 to 35 years old**. The most common occupations in this group are **students (12)** and **administrators (7)**, with the majority being **single**.
- **Green Cluster**: Includes customers aged **28 to 39 years old**. The most frequent occupations in this group are **management (0)** and **technician (1)**, with most individuals being **married**.
- **Purple Cluster**: Includes customers aged **39 to 47 years old**. The predominant occupations in this cluster are **admin, services, self-employed, and unemployed**, with the majority being **married**.
- **Blue Cluster**: Includes customers aged **48 to 58 years old**. The most common occupations in this group are **management, technician, entrepreneur, blue-collar, admin, services, and unemployed**, with most individuals being **married**.

These insights help in understanding customer segmentation, which can be used to target specific demographics for future marketing campaigns.
